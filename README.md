==================================================

## Overview
Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

Placed 202 ([JMT5802](https://www.kaggle.com/jimthompson)) out of 4,915 teams on the private leaderboard.  At this time Top 4% finisher (preliminary).

## Key Artifacts
* Kernel for feature analysis to [determine relevant modeling attributes](https://www.kaggle.com/jimthompson/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/boruta-feature-importance-analysis).
* Kernel for illustrating a [two-level stacked model](https://www.kaggle.com/jimthompson/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/ensemble-model-stacked-model-example).  
* Rmarkdown for a [three-level stacked model](https://github.com/jimthompson5802/kaggle-HousePrice/blob/master/src/stack_model/stack_model3.Rmd), which is my best performing model.  This [page shows the stacked model structure](https://github.com/jimthompson5802/kaggle-HousePrice/wiki).
* Kernel for R-based [regularized linear regression](https://www.kaggle.com/jimthompson/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/regularized-linear-models-in-r).
